This action keeps your `pre-commit` hooks up to date and creates pull request.

<br>

On the `GitHub Marketplace`, most of the actions that update `pre-commit` hooks run `pre-commit autoupdate` under the hood.  Among them, some stitch together with another action to create pull request.  Unfortunately, a lot of them are not regularly maintained.

<br>

Hence comes **update-pre-commit-action**, which uses [**update-pre-commit**](https://github.com/tagdots/update-pre-commit) with the goal to:
1. reduce your supply chain risks with `openssf best practices` in our development and operation.
1. automate your `change management operation` with built-in feature to create `pull request` on **GitHub**.
1. protect you from using unreliable revs such as `alpha`, `beta`, `prerelease`, and `rc`.

## üòé Roll out 1 2 3

1. use the example workflows below to create your own workflow inside `.github/workflows/`.
1. merge your code with the new workflow.
1. done!!

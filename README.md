This action uses [**update-pre-commit**](https://github.com/tagdots/update-pre-commit) to keep your `pre-commit` configuration up to date and

1. reduces your supply chain risks by following best practices in its development and operation.
1. simplifies your change management process by having both _updates_ and _pull request_ in the same code base.
1. protects you by not accepting revs tagged with "_alpha_", "_beta_", "_prerelease_", and "_rc_".
